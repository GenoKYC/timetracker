## 🏷️ Project Name:

**TimeTracker**

---

## 📌 1. Project Foundation

### **Description**

TimeTracker is a **time management and employee monitoring system** designed to help companies efficiently track employee attendance, working hours, and productivity. The platform allows employees to log their working sessions (Time In/Time Out) while giving employers insights into daily, weekly, and monthly reports.

It uses a **modern tech stack** (Angular + Tailwind CSS for the frontend, MongoDB for the backend) to ensure scalability, clean UI/UX, and robust data management.

## 📌 2. Problem Statement

### **Challenges Addressed**

- Many companies still rely on **manual time-tracking systems** (logbooks, spreadsheets) that are prone to **errors, manipulation, and inefficiency**.
- Employees sometimes forget to log their work sessions, causing inaccuracies in payroll and productivity tracking.
- Employers lack **real-time visibility** of employee activity and accurate reporting for decision-making.
- Existing solutions may be **expensive** or too complex for small-to-medium businesses.

## 📌 3. Solution Overview

### **Description**

TimeTracker solves these challenges by providing:

- A **digital platform** where employees can log their working hours (time in/time out).
- **Camera/photo verification** for proof of attendance.
- A **secure database (MongoDB)** to store attendance logs.
- A **modern Angular frontend** with Tailwind styling for a responsive and user-friendly UI.
- A **company dashboard** to analyze employee attendance, generate reports, and visualize productivity trends.

## 📌 5. Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**

  - **Angular (TypeScript)** → for component-driven, scalable UI
  - **Tailwind CSS** → for responsive, modern styling
  - **PrimeNG / DaisyUI** (optional) → for UI components

- **Backend:**

  - **Node.js + Express** → REST API
  - **MongoDB (Mongoose ORM)** → Database

- **Other Tools:**

  - JWT → Authentication
  - Multer / Base64 → Image storage for snapshots
  - Chart.js or ngx-charts → Data visualization

---

## 📌 6. System Flow (Foundation Flow of Website Terms/Concept)

### **Step 1 – Landing Page**

- Visitors see the **landing page** with features and a call-to-action (Sign Up / Log In).
- Styled using Angular + Tailwind.

### **Step 2 – Authentication**

- **Sign Up (Company)** → Admin registers a company account.
- **Log In** → Employees/Admins access the dashboard.

### **Step 3 – Employee Time Logging**

- Employee clicks **Time In** → Camera opens → Snapshot taken → Record saved in MongoDB with timestamp.
- At end of shift, employee clicks **Time Out** → Process repeats.

### **Step 4 – Data Storage**

- MongoDB stores logs:

  ```json
  {
    "employeeId": "12345",
    "timeIn": "2025-09-09T08:00:00Z",
    "timeOut": "2025-09-09T17:00:00Z",
    "imageProof": "base64string",
    "status": "Completed"
  }
  ```

### **Step 5 – Dashboard**

- Admin views a **dashboard**:

  - Employee list with attendance status (Present/Absent).
  - Graphs showing hours worked per employee.
  - Export options (CSV, PDF).

### **Step 6 – Reports & Analytics**

- Admin generates reports for payroll or productivity.
- Insights include total hours, overtime, absences.
